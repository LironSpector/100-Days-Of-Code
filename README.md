# 100 Days of Code — Python Projects Collection

A set of Python projects completed while following the **“100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp”** course. Each folder is a project (GUI, CLI, web, automation, data/APIs), named `day XX - <project>` with its own `main.py` (and helpers).


## Getting Started
> Some projects require API keys or credentials (e.g., Spotify, Twilio, Tequila/Kiwi, SMTP). Use **environment variables** or a local `.env` file.
> In addition, each project is independent: the repository groups many projects together.


## Example Projects
- **Day 39–40 — Flight Deal Finder**  
  Searches cheap flights using the **Tequila (Kiwi)** API, stores/reads routes and price thresholds via **Sheety/Google Sheets**, and sends deal alerts via **Twilio SMS / Email**.

- **Day 47 — Amazon Price Tracker**  
  Scrapes product pages with **BeautifulSoup**, checks against the user's target price (from a sheet/DB), and emails the user when the price drops.

- **Day 46 — Spotify Playlist (Billboard Top 100)**  
  Parses the Billboard chart for a given date and builds a private playlist via the **Spotify Web API**.

- **Day 63 — Bookshelf Website**  
  A small **Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite** CRUD app to track books (title/author/rating), demonstrating templates, forms, and database operations.
